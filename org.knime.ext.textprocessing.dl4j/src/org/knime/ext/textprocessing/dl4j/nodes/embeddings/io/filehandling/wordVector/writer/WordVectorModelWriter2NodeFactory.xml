	<name>Word Vector Model Writer</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Node to write word vector models.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node saves a word vector model to the specified location, which
			can be later read
			by the corresponding reader node. The written file
			is a .zip file with
			the following content:
			<ul>
				<li>'word_vector_trainings_mode' - Text file containing the type of
					word vector model which was written
				</li>
				<li>'word_vectors' - File containing the word vector model in DL4J
					format.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</intro>

		<option name="Write to">
				Select a file system in which you want to store the file.
				There are four default file system options to choose from:
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li><i>Local File System:</i> Allows you to select a location in your
	                    local system.
	                </li>
	                <li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Allows you to read from a mountpoint.
	                	When selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose the mountpoint.
	                	Unconnected mountpoints are greyed out but can still be selected (note that browsing is disabled in this case).
	                	Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.
	                	A mountpoint is displayed in red if it was previously selected but is no longer available.
	                	You won't be able to save the dialog as long as you don't select a valid i.e. known mountpoint.
	                </li>
	                <li><i>Relative to:</i> Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path
						relative to the current mountpoint, current workflow or the current workflow's data area.
	                When selected a new drop-down menu appears to choose which of the three options to use.
	                </li>
					<li><i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i> Allows to specify a URL (e.g. file://, http:// or knime:// protocol). 
	                    When selected, a spinner appears that allows you to specify the desired connection and write timeout in milliseconds.
	                    In case it takes longer to connect to the host / write the file, the node fails to execute.
	                    Browsing is disabled for this option.
	                </li>
				</ul>
				It is possible to use other file systems with this node. Therefore,
				you have to enable the file system connection input port of this
				node
				by clicking the
				<b>...</b>
				in the bottom left corner of the node's icon and choose
				<i>Add File System Connection port</i>
				.
				<br />
				Afterwards, you can simply connect the desired connector node to this node.
				The file system connection will then be shown in the drop-down menu.
			</option>

			<option name="File/URL">
				Enter a URL when writing to <i>Custom/KNIME URL</i>, otherwise enter a path to a file. The
				required syntax of a path depends on the chosen file system, such as &quot;C:\path\to\file&quot; (Local
				File System on Windows) or  &quot;/path/to/file&quot; (Local
	            File System on Linux/MacOS and Mountpoint). For file systems connected via input port, the node
	            description of the respective connector node describes the required path format.
				You can also choose a previously selected file from the drop-down list, or select a location
				from the &quot;Browse...&quot; dialog.
				Note that browsing is disabled in some cases:
				<ul>
					<li><i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i> Browsing is always disabled.</li>
					<li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Browsing is disabled if the selected mountpoint isn't connected.
					Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.</li>
					<li><i>File systems provided via input port:</i>
					Browsing is disabled if the connector node hasn't been executed since the workflow has been opened.
					(Re)execute the connector node to enable browsing.</li>
				</ul>
			</option>
			<option name="Create missing folders">Select if the folders of the selected
				output
				location should be created if they do not already exist. If
				this
				option is unchecked, the node will fail if a folder does not
				exist.
			</option>
			<option name="If exists">
				Specify the behavior of the node in case the output file already exists.
				<ul>
					<li><i>Overwrite:</i> Will replace any existing file.
					</li>
					<li><i>Fail:</i> Will issue an error during the node's execution (to prevent unintentional overwrite).
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>
