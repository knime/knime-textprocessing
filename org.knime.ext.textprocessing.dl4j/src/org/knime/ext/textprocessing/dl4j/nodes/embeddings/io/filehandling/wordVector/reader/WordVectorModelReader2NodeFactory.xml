	<name>Word Vector Model Reader (Labs)</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Node to read word vector models.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node reads word vector models of different formats:
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>KNIME</b>
					- Models previously saved by the Word Vector Writer Node.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Text</b>
					- Models in standard text format (file ending may be .txt or .csv).
					Each row contains the word in the first column and the
					vector in the
					following columns with the following properties:
					<br />
					Column separator: single whitespace (multiple whitespace, tab and
					comma are not supported)
					<br />
					Decimal separator: dot
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Binary</b>
					- Compressed or uncompressed binary model like the well known
					Google News Vectors model (file ending should be .bin.gz).
				</li>
			</ul>
			Note that for external model formats (Text or Binary) only Word2Vec
			models are supported. Some
			compatible pretrained Word2Vec models are
			the following:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a
						href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit">Google News Vectors</a>
					Note: Very large model, may take some time to read.
				</li>

				<li>
					<a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/">GloVe</a>
					Note: These models are in text format and need to be extracted
					first.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</intro>

		<option name="Read from">
			Select a file system which stores the word vector model you want to
			read. There are four default file system options to choose from:
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>Local File System: Allows you to select a file from your
					local
					system.
				</li>
				<li>Mountpoint: Allows you to choose a mountpoint. Whenever this is
					selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose from available
					mountpoints.
				</li>
				<li>Custom URL: Uses the standard URL handler providing the ability
					to read a file from URLs (e.g. file, http or KNIME protocol).
					Browsing is disabled for this option.
				</li>
			</ul>
			It is possible to use other file systems with this node. Therefore,
			you have to enable the file system connection input port of this node
			by clicking the
			<b>...</b>
			in the bottom left corner of the node's icon
			and choose
			<i>Add File System Connection port</i>
			.
			<br />
			Afterwards, you can simply connect the desired connector node to the
			reader node. The file system connection will then be shown in the
			drop down menu.
		</option>
		<option name="File/URL">
			Enter a valid destination. Depending on the selected file system this
			is either a path (used by
			<i>Local File System</i>
			,
			<i>Relative to</i>
			,
			<i>Mountpoint</i>
			options and custom file systems added by specific connector nodes) or
			a URL (used by
			<i>Custom URL</i>
			option).
			<br />
			A path usually starts with a slash (/) character and does not contain
			a protocol.
			You can also choose a previously selected file from
			the
			drop-down list, or select a destination from the
			&quot;Browse...&quot; dialog (browsing is not available for custom
			URLs).
		</option>
		<option name="Timeout (ms)">
			Timeout in milliseconds when connecting to remote resources / reading
			remote files.
			<tt>0</tt>
			means no
			timeout. In case it takes longer to connect to the host /
			read the file, the
			node fails to
			execute.
			<br />
			<i>Note</i>
			: This option is only active in case that the
			<i>Custom URL</i>
			file system is selected. Other file
			systems don't use a timeout or the
			timeout is set directly in the specific
			connector node.
