	<shortDescription>
		Node to read word vector models.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node reads word vector models of different formats:
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>KNIME</b>
					- Models previously saved by the Word Vector Writer Node.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Text</b>
					- Models in standard text format (file ending may be .txt or .csv).
					Each row contains the word in the first column and the
					vector in the
					following columns with the following properties:
					<br />
					Column separator: single whitespace (multiple whitespace, tab and
					comma are not supported)
					<br />
					Decimal separator: dot
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Binary</b>
					- Compressed or uncompressed binary model like the well known
					Google News Vectors model (file ending should be .bin.gz).
				</li>
			</ul>
			Note that for external model formats (Text or Binary) only Word2Vec
			models are supported. Some
			compatible pretrained Word2Vec models are
			the following:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a
						href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit">Google News Vectors</a>
					Note: Very large model, may take some time to read.
				</li>

				<li>
					<a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/">GloVe</a>
					Note: These models are in text format and need to be extracted
					first.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</intro>

		<option name="Read from">
			Select a file system which stores the model you want to read. There
			are four default file system options to choose from:
			<br />
			<ul>
	                <li><i>Local File System:</i> Allows you to select a file from your
	                    local system.
	                </li>
	                <li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Allows you to read from a mountpoint.
	                	When selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose the mountpoint.
	                	Unconnected mountpoints are greyed out but can still be selected (note that browsing is disabled in this case).
	                	Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.
	                	A mountpoint is displayed in red if it was previously selected but no longer available.
	                	You won't be able to save the dialog as long as you don't select a valid i.e. known mountpoint.
	                </li>
	                <li><i>Relative to:</i> Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path
						relative to the workflow or mountpoint.
	                When selected a new drop-down menu appears to choose which of the two options to use.
	                </li>
	                <li><i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i> Allows to specify a URL (e.g. file://, http:// or knime:// protocol). 
	                    When selected, a spinner appears that allows you to specify the desired connection and read timeout in milliseconds.
	                    In case it takes longer to connect to the host / read the file, the node fails to execute.
	                    Browsing is disabled for this option.
	                </li>
				</ul>
			It is possible to use other file systems with this node. Therefore,
			you have to enable the file system connection input port of this node
			by clicking the
			<b>...</b>
			in the bottom left corner of the node's icon and choose
			<i>Add File System Connection port</i>
			.
			<br />
			Afterwards, you can simply connect the desired connector node to this node.
			The file system connection will then be shown in the drop-down menu.
		</option>
		<option name="File/URL">
			Enter a URL when reading from <i>Custom/KNIME URL</i>, otherwise enter a path to a file. The
				required syntax of a path depends on the chosen file system, such as &quot;C:\path\to\file&quot; (Local
				File System on Windows) or  &quot;/path/to/file&quot; (Local
	            File System on Linux/MacOS and Mountpoint). For file systems connected via input port, the node
	            description of the respective connector node describes the required path format.
				You can also choose a previously selected file from the drop-down list, or select a location
				from the &quot;Browse...&quot; dialog.
				Note that browsing is disabled in some cases:
				<ul>
					<li><i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i> Browsing is always disabled.</li>
					<li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Browsing is disabled if the selected mountpoint isn't connected.
					Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.</li>
					<li><i>File systems provided via input port:</i>
					Browsing is disabled if the connector node hasn't been executed since the workflow has been opened.
					(Re)execute the connector node to enable browsing.</li>
				</ul>
