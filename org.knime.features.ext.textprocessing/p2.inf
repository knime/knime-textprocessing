# Added in 4.2.1 as part of AP-14809:
# org.dom4j_1.6.1 is also available via orbit (https://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/drops/R20200224183213/)
# but imports java.xml.bind, v2.2. This causes two version of the same package to be available in KNIME, which prevents
# under certain conditions certain extensions not to load.
# 
# dom4j is indirectly used via apache.poi, which is used in textprocessing
